The [VIPER AUV](http://www.farcotech.com/?q=content/underwater-vehicles) is a hydrodynamically efficient, 
man-portable, autonomous underwater vehicle. It is designed for autonomous riverine reconnaissance and 
bathymetery. The sensor payload includes a DVL, several sonars, IMU, GPS, and pressure sensor. The vehicle
utilizes the [Dual-Processor Autopilot]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/autopilot) for its control system.

While working for [Farco Technologies](http://www.farcotech.com), I 
was responsible for the mechanical/electrical design, fabrication, and integration of the VIPER AUV.
While I was not involved in the initial hydrodynamic design, in later stages I designed and implemented:

  - Hydrostatic and hydrodynamic seals
  - Motor and motor controller selection
  - Power electronics
  - Wiring and system integration
  - Vehicle balancing and ballast
