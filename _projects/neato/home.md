Rene is a Raspberry Pi, ROS, and Botvac based project for investigating SLAM, tracking, and other mobile robot based
applications. Named Rene after [Ren√© Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes), from where we
get the Cartesian coordinate system, analytical geometry, and his philosophies on the nature of being.
I also enjoy that the name, when pronounced, is gender ambiguous.
It is still under development.
