The robot filters library is a project to build various filters useful in robotics applications.
These include:

  - Linear filters (low pass, high pass, etc.)
  - Extended kalman filters
  - Particle filters

The aim is to have a library that can be easily used to do various tasks including simultaneous
localization and mapping, object tracking, signal processing.

The code for the project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/griswaldbrooks/robot_filters).
