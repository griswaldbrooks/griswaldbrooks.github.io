For my graduate research and Master's Thesis, I worked with the [Nao Humanoid Platform](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/cool-robots/nao).

I programmed Nao to navigate with [GODZILA](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2014.6852631) and to [crawl](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7354220).

In 2015, I presented at [IROS](http://www.iros2015.org/) on my [crawling algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/embed/leQpX1VDJok).

Videos of my work with Nao can be viewed [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/nao/videos/)

Code from the project can be viewed on my github:
