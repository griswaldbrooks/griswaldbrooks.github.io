# IROS 2015

This video was made for the IROS 2015 Conference. It briefly explains the Projected Profile concept, 
executed by the Nao as in the previous video. It also demonstrates the Nao, approaching a crawl area, 
crawling under the area, and taking a sitting pose when it has cleared the crawl area.

This is a video of me at the IROS 2015 Conference presenting my work on the Projected Profile crawl gait.

## GODZILA Navigation
---

# Lidar

These videos demonstrate the Nao navigating to a goal, represented by a red cube, using a Hokuyo URG-04 for
obstacle avoidance. The GODZILA Navigation algorithm is used to plan the path.

# Sonar

This video demonstrates the Nao navigating to a goal using the GODZILA navigation algorithm.
The Nao is using only its built-in sonars for obstacle avoidance.
