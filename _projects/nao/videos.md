## Projected Profile Crawling
---

This video demonstrates the Projected Profile crawl gait, implemented on the Nao.

This video shows a simulation of the closed chain phase of the Projected Profile crawl gait with the knee and
hip joints held at a fixed angle.

This video shows a simulation of the closed chain phase of the Projected Profile crawl gait.
The knee and hip joint angular trajectories were optimized to minimize joint torques.
A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the trajectories.

# IROS 2015

This video was made for the IROS 2015 Conference. It briefly explains the Projected Profile concept, 
executed by the Nao as in the previous video. It also demonstrates the Nao, approaching a crawl area, 
crawling under the area, and taking a sitting pose when it has cleared the crawl area.

This is a video of me at the IROS 2015 Conference presenting my work on the Projected Profile crawl gait.

## GODZILA Navigation
---

# Lidar

These videos demonstrate the Nao navigating to a goal, represented by a red cube, using a Hokuyo URG-04 for
obstacle avoidance. The GODZILA Navigation algorithm is used to plan the path.

# Sonar

This video demonstrates the Nao navigating to a goal using the GODZILA navigation algorithm.
The Nao is using only its built-in sonars for obstacle avoidance.

# Trinity Simulation

This video shows the Trinity Simulator being used to simulate the Nao with its sonars running the 
GODZILA navigation algorithm.
