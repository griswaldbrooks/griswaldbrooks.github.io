## What to expect?
Board game nights are a casual, social event directed towards roboticists and
their friends and family. It's an opportunity to meet other roboticists,
network, and play board games.
The events are typically hosted at a robotics company or
other social space. Depending on the venue and interest, food and drinks may be
provided. The events are typically held in the evening and last for a few hours.

## What games?
Typically, a range of board games are available ranging from relatively easy games to learn and play to more
challenging games which might require a few hours.

An example of a short game might be [Codenames](https://czechgames.com/en/codenames/)

## What to bring?
The host will have a selection of games, but more games are always welcome!
Have a robotics project you'd like to show off? Bring it along!
Perphaps a hot take on continuous integration or model predictive control?

## Who to invite?
Anyone who might be interested in playing board games with roboticists or
robotics enthusiasts. The events are open to friends and family, but are
not intended for the general public.

## Age restrictions?
Our events don't have an age limit and are usually family-friendly.
Though if the event is at a bar, minor's cannot attend, but that's rare.
Usually we meet at robotics companies or hacker spaces, where it's totally cool to bring the kids.
High school and college robotics club members are regulars too!

## Photography
We typically take photos at the events and post them on the website.
If you'd prefer not to be photographed, or if you
see a photo of yourself that you'd like removed, please let us know.
If your company has a policy against photography, we'll refrain from taking
photos at your event.
