I'm a Robotics Engineer living in the Greater Boston Area with an interest in mobile robotics.
In the past, I've worked on object tracking, estimator design, controller design, navigation, and path planning.
I've dabbled with SLAM and machine learning algorithms and hope to work with them more in the future.
